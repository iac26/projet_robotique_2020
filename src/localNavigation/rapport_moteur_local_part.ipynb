    "In our project, the trajectory of robot is constitued by a series of coordinates of passage points. In order to make Thymio  move to a given coordinate (here goal) and be able to avoid the obstacles near to it on the way, we control the Thymio with <b>3 speeds in parallel </b> : \n",

Here we will define the <b>\"error angle\"</b> as the how much Thymio should rotate in order to aligne with the goal. During the tracking, Thymio computes in each iteration the error angle and commands the motors in fonction of this error. The error angle is computed based on the knowlege of Thymio's actual position, goal position and Thymio's actual orientation. A simplified schemas can illustrate this geometry problem, we will adapt the sign convention of angle, positive for clockwise and negative for counter clockwise: \n",

    "Once the error angle is obtained, Thymio will move. The motors command of Thymio at time T is generated by a PID controler, which controls the wheels speed in using the error. We simply compute the $\\sum_{t=0}^T e(t)$ by summing up the errors from beginning $e(0)$ to the moment T $e(T)$, and $\\delta error$ by calculating the difference between actual error $e(T)$ and $e(T-1)$, the error at time T-1.\n",

However, we observe that Thymio moved with lots of overshoot, so the term $K_D$ is added at the end to <b>reduce this overshoot</b>.

    "### Local avoidance using  Artificial Neural Networks with Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of local avoidance is that Thymio should detect and avoid the obstacles on its way, while keeping tracking the trajectory to the goal as good as possible. To achieve this behavior, the speed command of Thymio should not only contain the avoidance speed, but also the PID control speed which intent to align Thymio's orientation to the goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The major difficulty in the design of a such avoidance speed controler comes from the fact that, Thymio has only proximity sensors in front and behind, but not on the sides. Since the local avoidance imposes that the obstacle should only be detected by proximity sensors, camera should not give any information about it to Thymio. Once Thymio successes to avoid the obstacle, the moment that the obstacle is not visible to Thymio (at time T=t+2h in the figure), Thymio will be controled only by PID tracking speed. Since the term of error and the sum of error are strongly increased during the avoidance phase, the PID controler will give a very high command on motors in order to aligne Thymio to the goal, which leads to the collision. \n",
    "To minimize this accident, we implement the <b>avoidance controler</b> in giving Thymio the capacity to <i>\"memorize\"</i>. This controler is based on the <b>artificial neural networks</b>.\n",

    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"memory_comparaison.PNG\" width=\"700\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "The working principe of our ANN controler is below: for each iteration, 7 proximity sensors measure the environment, these measurements are stored in an array x[0:7]. Each sensor measurment is assigned to a weight, the weights of all 7 sensors measurements are stored in the arrays w_l[0:7] and w_r[0:7], the amplitude of weight means the importance of the measurement to the wheels' speed, the signe of weight impact the direction of wheels' speed.\n",
    "Concerning the memory part, x[7] and x[8] store the \"degraded memory\". The final speeds of left and right wheels are obtained by the multiplication between x array and w array. With this approch, the actual avoidance speed is not only dependent on proiomity sensors measurements, but also on the <i>\"memory\"</i> of previous avoidance speeds, so that Thymio can stay in avoidance phase longer, in order to better pass through the obstacle without collision (see Figure right).\n",
