Here we will define the \"error angle\" as the how much Thymio should rotate in order to aligne with the goal. During the tracking, Thymio computes in each iteration the error angle and commands the motors in fonction of this error. The error angle is computed based on the knowlege of Thymio's actual position, goal position and Thymio's actual orientation. A simplified schemas can illustrate this geometry problem, we will adapt the sign convention of angle, positive for clockwise and negative for counter clockwise: \n",

We simply compute the $\\sum_{t=0}^T e(t)$ by summing up the errors from beginning $e(0)$ to the moment T $e(T)$, and $\\delta error$ by calculating the difference between actual error $e(T)$ and $e(T-1)$, the error at time T-1.\n",

However, we observe that Thymio moved with lots of overshoot, so the term $K_D$ is added at the end.
